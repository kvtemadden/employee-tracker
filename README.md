## Functionality
This product can be used to complete many tasks, such as viewing breakdowns of:
- Total employees
- Employees by department
- Employees by role
- Department budgets
- Employees of a certain manager
- View the roles
- View the departments.

On top of this, the user is able to:
- Add an employee
- Remove an employee
- Add a department
- Remove a department
- Add a role
- Remove a role
- And update employee information in certain areas, too.

This allows management teams to manage their employees in one spot, purely by answering prompts.

The app will then create/update/delete/select a record in the database based on the user's actions.
